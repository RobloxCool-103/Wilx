Here in a few lines I am going to explain the use of my code:
Beforehand, I would like to say that this is just a small, passion project and the code is not written by me just edited litle.
Disclaimer : Do not use my code for any kind of real websites, because this is just basic demo code for anyone who wants to take insperation from existing code
furthermore, this code is not professinally written, although I try my best to make it by deleting the bad and failed projects
although one coder who has coded it all can argue that if I give my best, no project would fail, which is true but I did mention above
that this is a passion project made to inspire and help learning coders, if you plan to use this code please make sure to improve it on the github page, now I will not find it now
but just search up 'Wilx' and you might be able to find it although, I might be a litle more descriptive to reach more people.
